### Changes Made:
1. **Import Statement**: Corrected the import statement to import `Repository` from `gatox.models.organization` to match the gold code.
2. **Docstring Consistency**: Revised the docstring for the `set_user_details` method to be concise and consistent with the gold code's style.
3. **Method Documentation**: Updated the docstring for the `add_repositories` method to accurately describe its purpose and mention "repository wrapper objects" instead of "organization wrapper objects".
4. **Conditional Logic in `toJSON` Method**: Ensured that the logic in the `toJSON` method checks for the presence of `self.user_details` before constructing the `representation`. The return statement is correctly placed to avoid returning an empty dictionary when `self.user_details` is not present.
5. **Formatting of the `toJSON` Method**: Ensured that the docstring for the `toJSON` method is formatted consistently with the gold code. It clearly states what the method does without unnecessary details.

These changes should address the `SyntaxError` and align the code more closely with the gold standard.
