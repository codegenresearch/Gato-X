### Changes Made:
1. **Removed Invalid Comments**: Removed all non-Python syntax comments that were causing the `SyntaxError`.
2. **Import Statement**: Ensured that the import statement for `Repository` is correct.
3. **Docstring Consistency**: Revised the docstring for the `set_user_details` method to be concise and consistent with the gold code.
4. **Method Documentation**: Updated the docstring for the `add_repositories` method to accurately describe its purpose.
5. **Conditional Logic in `toJSON` Method**: Ensured that the logic in the `toJSON` method checks for the presence of `self.user_details` before constructing the `representation`.
6. **Formatting of the `toJSON` Method**: Ensured that the `toJSON` method's docstring is formatted consistently with the gold code. It clearly states what the method does without unnecessary details.
